- [ ] Why would you use class component over function components (removing hooks from the question)?

  Lifecycle methods or dev's preferred syntax.

- [ ] Name three lifecycle methods and their purposes.

  1. componentDidMount: Only gets called once after render, updates state and then directs back to render.

  2. render: Renders JSX onto the webpage.

  3. componentDidUpdate: Gets called every time the component is updated. Takes two params (prevProps, prevState) - props before and after the update

- [ ] What is the purpose of a custom hook?

  Custom hooks allow you to use state without writing a class and share and reuse small pieces of code.

- [ ] Why is it important to test our apps?

  For reassurance, peace of mind, and to be sure that your code's output is the expected solution.
